# NoteAI

NoteAI is a tool designed to help students enforce what they have already learned, improving grades and helping them to learn more effectively.

## How we made it

Ryan wrote the frontend in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using bootstrap).

Alec wrote the backend in Python, using the FastAPI framework, and GPT-3.5-Turbo to generate the practice questions.

Robert wrote the database in Python using SQLite.

## How it works

When you write your notes in the app, you will see to the left a lightbulb button, and a selector for the number of questions to generate. When you press the button, the app will generate the number of questions you selected, and you can then practice them. Once you are done, you can press the "Check Answers" button to see how you did and GPT-3.5-Turbo will explain why you missed what you missed.
